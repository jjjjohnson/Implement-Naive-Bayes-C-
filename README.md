# Implement-Naive-Bayes-C-
A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the behavior of vehicles on a highway. The object for this classifier is to predict which of these three maneuvers a vehicle is engaged in given a single coordinate (sampled from the trajectories shown below).
Each coordinate contains 4 pieces of information:
- s
- d
- s_dot
- d_dot

This implementation is based on [Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes)
